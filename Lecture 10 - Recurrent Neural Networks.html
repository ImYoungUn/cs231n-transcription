<h1>Lecture 10 - Recurrent Neural Networks</h1>
<br/>
<p>Okay. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">00:07</span></p>
<p>Can everyone hear me? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">00:08</span></p>
<p>Okay. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">00:10</span></p>
<p>Sorry for the delay. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">00:11</span></p>
<p>I had a bit of technical difficulty. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">00:12</span></p>
<p>Today was the first time I was trying to use my new touch bar Mac book pro for presenting, and none of the adapters are working. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">00:13</span></p>
<p>So, I had to switch laptops at the last minute. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">00:19</span></p>
<p>So, thanks. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">00:21</span></p>
<p>Sorry about that. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">00:24</span></p>
<p>So, today is lecture 10. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">00:25</span></p>
<p>We're talking about recurrent neural networks. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">00:27</span></p>
<p>So, as of, as usual, a couple administrative notes. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">00:30</span></p>
<p>So, We're working hard on assignment one grading. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">00:33</span></p>
<p>Those grades will probably be out sometime later today. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">00:37</span></p>
<p>Hopefully, they can get out before the A2 deadline. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">00:40</span></p>
<p>That's what I'm hoping for. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">00:44</span></p>
<p>On a related note, Assignment two is due today at p.m. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">00:46</span></p>
<p>so, who's done with that already? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">00:50</span></p>
<p>About half you guys. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">00:55</span></p>
<p>So, you remember, I did warn you when the assignment went out that it was quite long, to start early. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">00:56</span></p>
<p>So, you were warned about that. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">01:01</span></p>
<p>But, hopefully, you guys have some late days left. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">01:03</span></p>
<p>Also, as another reminder, the midterm will be in class on Tuesday. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">01:06</span></p>
<p>If you kind of look around the lecture hall, there are not enough seats in this room to seat all the enrolled students in the class. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">01:10</span></p>
<p>So, we'll actually be having the midterm in several other lecture halls across campus. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">01:15</span></p>
<p>And we'll be sending out some more details on exactly where to go in the next couple of days. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">01:20</span></p>
<p>So a bit of a, another bit of announcement. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">01:26</span></p>
<p>We've been working on this sort of fun bit of extra credit thing for you to play with that we're calling the training game. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">01:28</span></p>
<p>This is this cool browser based experience, where you can go in and interactively train neural networks and tweak the hyper parameters during training. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">01:33</span></p>
<p>And this should be a really cool interactive way for you to practice some of these hyper parameter tuning skills that we've been talking about the last couple of lectures. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">01:39</span></p>
<p>So this is not required, but this, I think, will be a really useful experience to gain a little bit more intuition into how some of these hyper parameters work for different types of data sets in practice. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">01:47</span></p>
<p>So we're still working on getting all the bugs worked out of this setup, and we'll probably send out some more instructions on exactly how this will work in the next couple of days. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">01:57</span></p>
<p>But again, not required. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">02:05</span></p>
<p>But please do check it out. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">02:07</span></p>
<p>I think it'll be really fun and a really cool thing for you to play with. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">02:08</span></p>
<p>And will give you a bit of extra credit if you do some, if you end up working with this and doing a couple of runs with it. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">02:11</span></p>
<p>So, we'll again send out some more details about this soon once we get all the bugs worked out. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">02:18</span></p>
<p>As a reminder, last time we were talking about CNN Architectures. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">02:24</span></p>
<p>We kind of walked through the time line of some of the various winners of the image net classification challenge, kind of the breakthrough result. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">02:28</span></p>
<p>As we saw was the AlexNet architecture in 2012, which was a nine layer convolutional network. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">02:35</span></p>
<p>It did amazingly well, and it sort of kick started this whole deep learning revolution in computer vision, and kind of brought a lot of these models into the mainstream. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">02:39</span></p>
<p>Then we skipped ahead a couple years, and saw that in 2014 image net challenge, we had these two really interesting models, VGG and GoogLeNet, which were much deeper. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">02:48</span></p>
<p>So VGG was, they had a 16 and a 19 layer model, and GoogLeNet was, I believe, a 22 layer model. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">02:56</span></p>
<p>Although one thing that is kind of interesting about these models is that the 2014 image net challenge was right before batch normalization was invented. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">03:02</span></p>
<p>So at this time, before the invention of batch normalization, training these relatively deep models of roughly twenty layers was very challenging. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">03:11</span></p>
<p>So, in fact, both of these two models had to resort to a little bit of hackery in order to get their deep models to converge. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">03:18</span></p>
<p>So for VGG, they had the 16 and 19 layer models, but actually they first trained an 11 layer model, because that was what they could get to converge. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">03:24</span></p>
<p>And then added some extra random layers in the middle and then continued training, actually training the 16 and 19 layer models. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">03:34</span></p>
<p>So, managing this training process was very challenging in 2014 before the invention of batch normalization. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">03:40</span></p>
<p>Similarly, for GoogLeNet, we saw that GoogLeNet has these auxiliary classifiers that were stuck into lower layers of the network. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">03:46</span></p>
<p>And these were not really needed for the class to, to get good classification performance. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">03:52</span></p>
<p>This was just sort of a way to cause extra gradient to be injected directly into the lower layers of the network. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">03:56</span></p>
<p>And this sort of, this again was before the invention of batch normalization and now once you have these networks with batch normalization, then you no longer need these slightly ugly hacks in order to get these deeper models to converge. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">04:03</span></p>
<p>Then we also saw in the 2015 image net challenge was this really cool model called ResNet, these residual networks that now have these shortcut connections that actually have these little residual blocks where we're going to take our input, pass it through the residual blocks, and then add that output of the, then add our input to the block, to the output from these convolutional layers. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">04:17</span></p>
<p>This is kind of a funny architecture, but it actually has two really nice properties. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">04:39</span></p>
<p>One is that if we just set all the weights in this residual block to zero, then this block is competing the identity. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">04:43</span></p>
<p>So in some way, it's relatively easy for this model to learn not to use the layers that it doesn't need. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">04:49</span></p>
<p>In addition, it kind of adds this interpretation to L2 regularization in the context of these neural networks, cause once you put L2 regularization, remember, on your, on the weights of your network, that's going to drive all the parameters towards zero. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">04:55</span></p>
<p>And maybe your standard convolutional architecture is driving towards zero. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">05:08</span></p>
<p>Maybe it doesn't make sense. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">05:11</span></p>
<p>But in the context of a residual network, if you drive all the parameters towards zero, that's kind of encouraging the model to not use layers that it doesn't need, because it will just drive those, the residual blocks towards the identity, whether or not needed for classification. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">05:12</span></p>
<p>The other really useful property of these residual networks has to do with the gradient flow in the backward paths. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">05:26</span></p>
<p>If you remember what happens at these addition gates in the backward pass, when upstream gradient is coming in through an addition gate, then it will split and fork along these two different paths. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">05:31</span></p>
<p>So then, when upstream gradient comes in, it'll take one path through these convolutional blocks, but it will also have a direct connection of the gradient through this residual connection. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">05:39</span></p>
<p>So then when you look at, when you imagine stacking many of these residual blocks on top of each other, and our network ends up with hundreds of, potentially hundreds of layers. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">05:50</span></p>
<p>Then, these residual connections give a sort of gradient super highway for gradients to flow backward through the entire network. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">05:59</span></p>
<p>And this allows it to train much easier and much faster. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">06:05</span></p>
<p>And actually allows these things to converge reasonably well, even when the model is potentially hundreds of layers deep. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">06:09</span></p>
<p>And this idea of managing gradient flow in your models is actually super important everywhere in machine learning. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">06:15</span></p>
<p>And super prevalent in recurrent networks as well. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">06:21</span></p>
<p>So we'll definitely revisit this idea of gradient flow later in today's lecture. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">06:23</span></p>
<p>So then, we kind of also saw a couple other more exotic, more recent CNN architectures last time, including DenseNet and FractalNet, and once you think about these architectures in terms of gradient flow, they make a little bit more sense. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">06:31</span></p>
<p>These things like DenseNet and FractalNet are adding these additional shortcut or identity connections inside the model. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">06:43</span></p>
<p>And if you think about what happens in the backwards pass for these models, these additional funny topologies are basically providing direct paths for gradients to flow from the loss at the end of the network more easily into all the different layers of the network. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">06:48</span></p>
<p>So I think that, again, this idea of managing gradient flow properly in your CNN Architectures is something that we've really seen a lot more in the last couple of years. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">07:00</span></p>
<p>And will probably see more moving forward as more exotic architectures are invented. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">07:09</span></p>
<p>We also saw this kind of nice plot, plotting performance of the number of flops versus the number of parameters versus the run time of these various models. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">07:16</span></p>
<p>And there's some interesting characteristics that you can dive in and see from this plot. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">07:24</span></p>
<p>One idea is that VGG and AlexNet have a huge number of parameters, and these parameters actually come almost entirely from the fully connected layers of the models. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">07:27</span></p>
<p>So AlexNet has something like roughly 62 million parameters, and if you look at that last fully connected layer, the final fully connected layer in AlexNet is going from an activation volume of six by six by 256 into this fully connected vector of 496. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">07:37</span></p>
<p>So if you imagine what the weight matrix needs to look like at that layer, the weight matrix is gigantic. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">07:51</span></p>
<p>It's number of entries is six by six, six times six times 256 times 496. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">07:56</span></p>
<p>And if you multiply that out, you see that that single layer has 38 million parameters. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">08:01</span></p>
<p>So more than half of the parameters of the entire AlexNet model are just sitting in that last fully connected layer. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">08:06</span></p>
<p>And if you add up all the parameters in just the fully connected layers of AlexNet, including these other fully connected layers, you see something like 59 of the 62 million parameters in AlexNet are sitting in these fully connected layers. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">08:11</span></p>
<p>So then when we move other architectures, like GoogLeNet and ResNet, they do away with a lot of these large fully connected layers in favor of global average pooling at the end of the network. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">08:24</span></p>
<p>And this allows these networks to really cut, these nicer architectures, to really cut down the parameter count in these architectures. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">08:33</span></p>
<p>So that was kind of our brief recap of the CNN architectures that we saw last lecture, and then today, we're going to move to one of my favorite topics to talk about, which is recurrent neural networks. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">08:44</span></p>
<p>So, so far in this class, we've seen, what I like to think of as kind of a vanilla feed forward network, all of our network architectures have this flavor, where we receive some input and that input is a fixed size object, like an image or vector. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">08:56</span></p>
<p>That input is fed through some set of hidden layers and produces a single output, like a classifications, like a set of classifications scores over a set of categories. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">09:08</span></p>
<p>But in some context in machine learning, we want to have more flexibility in the types of data that our models can process. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">09:20</span></p>
<p>So once we move to this idea of recurrent neural networks, we have a lot more opportunities to play around with the types of input and output data that our networks can handle. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">09:25</span></p>
<p>So once we have recurrent neural networks, we can do what we call these one to many models. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">09:35</span></p>
<p>Or where maybe our input is some object of fixed size, like an image, but now our output is a sequence of variable length, such as a caption. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">09:41</span></p>
<p>Where different captions might have different numbers of words, so our output needs to be variable in length. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">09:48</span></p>
<p>We also might have many to one models, where our input could be variably sized. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">09:54</span></p>
<p>This might be something like a piece of text, and we want to say what is the sentiment of that text, whether it's positive or negative in sentiment. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">09:58</span></p>
<p>Or in a computer vision context, you might imagine taking as input a video, and that video might have a variable number of frames. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">10:06</span></p>
<p>And now we want to read this entire video of potentially variable length. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">10:12</span></p>
<p>And then at the end, make a classification decision about maybe what kind of activity or action is going on in that video. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">10:16</span></p>
<p>We also have a, we might also have problems where we want both the inputs and the output to be variable in length. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">10:22</span></p>
<p>We might see something like this in machine translation, where our input is some, maybe, sentence in English, which could have a variable length, and our output is maybe some sentence in French, which also could have a variable length. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">10:29</span></p>
<p>And crucially, the length of the English sentence might be different from the length of the French sentence. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">10:41</span></p>
<p>So we need some models that have the capacity to accept both variable length sequences on the input and on the output. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">10:46</span></p>
<p>Finally, we might also consider problems where our input is variably length, like something like a video sequence with a variable number of frames. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">10:53</span></p>
<p>And now we want to make a decision for each element of that input sequence. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">11:01</span></p>
<p>So in the context of videos, that might be making some classification decision along every frame of the video. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">11:04</span></p>
<p>And recurrent neural networks are this kind of general paradigm for handling variable sized sequence data that allow us to pretty naturally capture all of these different types of setups in our models. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">11:11</span></p>
<p>So recurring neural networks are actually important, even for some problems that have a fixed size input and a fixed size output. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">11:24</span></p>
<p>Recurrent neural networks can still be pretty useful. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">11:31</span></p>
<p>So in this example, we might want to do, for example, sequential processing of our input. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">11:33</span></p>
<p>So here, we're receiving a fixed size input like an image, and we want to make a classification decision about, like, what number is being shown in this image? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">11:38</span></p>
<p>But now, rather than just doing a single feed forward pass and making the decision all at once, this network is actually looking around the image and taking various glimpses of different parts of the image. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">11:46</span></p>
<p>And then after making some series of glimpses, then it makes its final decision as to what kind of number is present. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">11:55</span></p>
<p>So here, we had one, So here, even though our input and outputs, our input was an image, and our output was a classification decision, even this context, this idea of being able to handle variably length processing with recurrent neural networks can lead to some really interesting types of models. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">12:01</span></p>
<p>There's a really cool paper that I like that applied this same type of idea to generating new images. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">12:17</span></p>
<p>Where now, we want the model to synthesize brand new images that look kind of like the images it saw in training, and we can use a recurrent neural network architecture to actually paint these output images sort of one piece at a time in the output. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">12:23</span></p>
<p>You can see that, even though our output is this fixed size image, we can have these models that are working over time to compute parts of the output one at a time sequentially. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">12:36</span></p>
<p>And we can use recurrent neural networds for that type of setup as well. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">12:46</span></p>
<p>So after this sort of cool pitch about all these cool things that RNNs can do, you might wonder, like what exactly are these things? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">12:51</span></p>
<p>So in general, a recurrent neural network is this little, has this little recurrent core cell and it will take some input x, feed that input into the RNN, and that RNN has some internal hidden state, and that internal hidden state will be updated every time that the RNN reads a new input. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">12:58</span></p>
<p>And that internal hidden state will be then fed back to the model the next time it reads an input. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">13:17</span></p>
<p>And frequently, we will want our RNN"s to also produce some output at every time step, so we'll have this pattern where it will read an input, update its hidden state, and then produce an output. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">13:23</span></p>
<p>So then the question is what is the functional form of this recurrence relation that we're computing? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">13:35</span></p>
<p>So inside this little green RNN block, we're computing some recurrence relation, with a function f. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">13:40</span></p>
<p>So this function f will depend on some weights, w. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">13:46</span></p>
<p>It will accept the previous hidden state, h t - 1, as well as the input at the current state, x t, and this will output the next hidden state, or the updated hidden state, that we call h t. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">13:49</span></p>
<p>And now, then as we read the next input, this hidden state, this new hidden state, h t, will then just be passed into the same function as we read the next input, x t plus one. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">14:01</span></p>
<p>And now, if we wanted to produce some output at every time step of this network, we might attach some additional fully connected layers that read in this h t at every time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">14:11</span></p>
<p>And make that decision based on the hidden state at every time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">14:21</span></p>
<p>And one thing to note is that we use the same function, f w, and the same weights, w, at every time step of the computation. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">14:27</span></p>
<p>So then kind of the simplest function form that you can imagine is what we call this vanilla recurrent neural network. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">14:36</span></p>
<p>So here, we have this same functional form from the previous slide, where we're taking in our previous hidden state and our current input and we need to produce the next hidden state. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">14:43</span></p>
<p>And the kind of simplest thing you might imagine is that we have some weight matrix, w x h, that we multiply against the input, x t, as well as another weight matrix, w h h, that we multiply against the previous hidden state. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">14:52</span></p>
<p>So we make these two multiplications against our two states, add them together, and squash them through a tanh, so we get some kind of non linearity in the system. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">15:05</span></p>
<p>You might be wondering why we use a tanh here and not some other type of non-linearity? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">15:13</span></p>
<p>After all that we've said negative about tanh's in previous lectures, and I think we'll return a little bit to that later on when we talk about more advanced architectures, like lstm. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">15:17</span></p>
<p>So then, this, So then, in addition in this architecture, if we wanted to produce some y t at every time step, you might have another weight matrix, w, you might have another weight matrix that accepts this hidden state and then transforms it to some y to produce maybe some class score predictions at every time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">15:27</span></p>
<p>And when I think about recurrent neural networks, I kind of think about, you can also, you can kind of think of recurrent neural networks in two ways. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">15:44</span></p>
<p>One is this concept of having a hidden state that feeds back at itself, recurrently. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">15:51</span></p>
<p>But I find that picture a little bit confusing. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">15:57</span></p>
<p>And sometimes, I find it clearer to think about unrolling this computational graph for multiple time steps. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">15:59</span></p>
<p>And this makes the data flow of the hidden states and the inputs and the outputs and the weights maybe a little bit more clear. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">16:05</span></p>
<p>So then at the first time step, we'll have some initial hidden state h zero. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">16:11</span></p>
<p>This is usually initialized to zeros for most context, in most contexts, an then we'll have some input, x t. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">16:15</span></p>
<p>This initial hidden state, h zero, and our current input, x t, will go into our f w function. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">16:22</span></p>
<p>This will produce our next hidden state, h one. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">16:28</span></p>
<p>And then, we'll repeat this process when we receive the next input. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">16:32</span></p>
<p>So now our current h one and our x one, will go into that same f w, to produce our next output, h two. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">16:36</span></p>
<p>And this process will repeat over and over again, as we consume all of the input, x ts, in our sequence of inputs. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">16:42</span></p>
<p>And now, one thing to note, is that we can actually make this even more explicit and write the w matrix in our computational graph. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">16:50</span></p>
<p>And here you can see that we're re-using the same w matrix at every time step of the computation. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">16:58</span></p>
<p>So now every time that we have this little f w block, it's receiving a unique h and a unique x, but all of these blocks are taking the same w. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">17:03</span></p>
<p>And if you remember, we talked about how gradient flows in back propagation, when you re-use the same, when you re-use the same node multiple times in a computational graph, then remember during the backward pass, you end up summing the gradients into the w matrix when you're computing a d los d w. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">17:11</span></p>
<p>So, if you kind of think about the back propagation for this model, then you'll have a separate gradient for w flowing from each of those time steps, and then the final gradient for w will be the sum of all of those individual per time step gradiants. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">17:28</span></p>
<p>We can also write to this y t explicitly in this computational graph. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">17:43</span></p>
<p>So then, this output, h t, at every time step might feed into some other little neural network that can produce a y t, which might be some class scores, or something like that, at every time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">17:47</span></p>
<p>We can also make the loss more explicit. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">17:59</span></p>
<p>So in many cases, you might imagine producing, you might imagine that you have some ground truth label at every time step of your sequence, and then you'll compute some loss, some individual loss, at every time step of these outputs, y t's. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">18:00</span></p>
<p>And this loss might, it will frequently be something like soft max loss, in the case where you have, maybe, a ground truth label at every time step of the sequence. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">18:14</span></p>
<p>And now the final loss for the entire, for this entire training stop, will be the sum of these individual losses. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">18:22</span></p>
<p>So now, we had a scaler loss at every time step? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">18:27</span></p>
<p>And we just summed them up to get our final scaler loss at the top of the network. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">18:30</span></p>
<p>And now, if you think about, again, back propagation through this thing, we need, in order to train the model, we need to compute the gradient of the loss with respect to w. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">18:34</span></p>
<p>So, we'll have loss flowing from that final loss into each of these time steps. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">18:42</span></p>
<p>And then each of those time steps will compute a local gradient on the weights, w, which will all then be summed to give us our final gradient for the weights, w. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">18:46</span></p>
<p>Now if we have a, sort of, this many to one situation, where maybe we want to do something like sentiment analysis, then we would typically make that decision based on the final hidden state of this network. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">18:55</span></p>
<p>Because this final hidden state kind of summarizes all of the context from the entire sequence. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">19:05</span></p>
<p>Also, if we have a kind of a one to many situation, where we want to receive a fix sized input and then produce a variably sized output. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">19:11</span></p>
<p>Then you'll commonly use that fixed size input to initialize, somehow, the initial hidden state of the model, and now the recurrent network will tick for each cell in the output. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">19:19</span></p>
<p>And now, as you produce your variably sized output, you'll unroll the graph for each element in the output. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">19:30</span></p>
<p>So this, when we talk about the sequence to sequence models where you might do something like machine translation, where you take a variably sized input and a variably sized output. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">19:38</span></p>
<p>You can think of this as a combination of the many to one, plus a one to many. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">19:47</span></p>
<p>So, we'll kind of proceed in two stages, what we call an encoder and a decoder. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">19:52</span></p>
<p>So if you're the encoder, we'll receive the variably sized input, which might be your sentence in English, and then summarize that entire sentence using the final hidden state of the encoder network. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">19:56</span></p>
<p>And now we're in this many to one situation where we've summarized this entire variably sized input in this single vector, and now, we have a second decoder network, which is a one to many situation, which will input that single vector summarizing the input sentence and now produce this variably sized output, which might be your sentence in another language. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">20:08</span></p>
<p>And now in this variably sized output, we might make some predictions at every time step, maybe about what word to use. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">20:28</span></p>
<p>And you can imagine kind of training this entire thing by unrolling this computational graph summing the losses at the output sequence and just performing back propagation, as usual. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">20:34</span></p>
<p>So as a bit of a concrete example, one thing that we frequently use recurrent neural networks for, is this problem called language modeling. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">20:44</span></p>
<p>So in the language modeling problem, we want to read some sequence of, we want to have our network, sort of, understand how to produce natural language. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">20:50</span></p>
<p>So in the, so this, this might happen at the character level where our model will produce characters one at a time. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">21:00</span></p>
<p>This might also happen at the word level where our model will produce words one at a time. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">21:06</span></p>
<p>But in a very simple example, you can imagine this character level language model where we want, where the network will read some sequence of characters and then it needs to predict, what will the next character be in this stream of text? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">21:10</span></p>
<p>So in this example, we have this very small vocabulary of four letters, h, e, l, and o, and we have this example training sequence of the word hello, h, e, l, l, o. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">21:22</span></p>
<p>So during training, when we're training this language model, we will feed the characters of this training sequence as inputs, as x ts, to out input of our, we'll feed the characters of our training sequence, these will be the x ts that we feed in as the inputs to our recurrent neural network. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">21:33</span></p>
<p>And then, each of these inputs, it's a letter, and we need to figure out a way to represent letters in our network. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">21:53</span></p>
<p>So what we'll typically do is figure out what is our total vocabulary. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">22:01</span></p>
<p>In this case, our vocabulary has four elements. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">22:05</span></p>
<p>And each letter will be represented by a vector that has zeros in every slot but one, and a one for the slot in the vocabulary corresponding to that letter. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">22:07</span></p>
<p>In this little example, since our vocab has the four letters, h, e, l, o, then our input sequence, the h is represented by a four element vector with a one in the first slot and zero's in the other three slots. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">22:16</span></p>
<p>And we use the same sort of pattern to represent all the different letters in the input sequence. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">22:28</span></p>
<p>Now, during this forward pass of what this network is doing, at the first time step, it will receive the input letter h. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">22:34</span></p>
<p>That will go into the first RNN, to the RNN cell, and then we'll produce this output, y t, which is the network making predictions about for each letter in the vocabulary, which letter does it think is most likely going to come next. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">22:41</span></p>
<p>In this example, the correct output letter was e because our training sequence was hello, but the model is actually predicting, I think it's actually predicting o as the most likely letter. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">22:56</span></p>
<p>So in this case, this prediction was wrong and we would use softmaxt loss to quantify our unhappiness with these predictions. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">23:07</span></p>
<p>The next time step, we would feed in the second letter in the training sequence, e, and this process will repeat. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">23:13</span></p>
<p>We'll now represent e as a vector. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">23:19</span></p>
<p>Use that input vector together with the previous hidden state to produce a new hidden state and now use the second hidden state to, again, make predictions over every letter in the vocabulary. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">23:22</span></p>
<p>In this case, because our training sequence was hello, after the letter e, we want our model to predict l. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">23:31</span></p>
<p>In this case, our model may have very low predictions for the letter l, so we would incur high loss. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">23:36</span></p>
<p>And you kind of repeat this process over and over, and if you train this model with many different sequences, then eventually it should learn how to predict the next character in a sequence based on the context of all the previous characters that it's seen before. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">23:44</span></p>
<p>And now, if you think about what happens at test time, after we train this model, one thing that we might want to do with it is a sample from the model, and actually use this trained neural network model to synthesize new text that kind of looks similar in spirit to the text that it was trained on. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">23:59</span></p>
<p>The way that this will work is we'll typically see the model with some input prefix of text. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">24:15</span></p>
<p>In this case, the prefix is just the single letter h, and now we'll feed that letter h through the first time step of our recurrent neural network. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">24:19</span></p>
<p>It will product this distribution of scores over all the characters in the vocabulary. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">24:27</span></p>
<p>Now, at training time, we'll use these scores to actually sample from it. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">24:32</span></p>
<p>So we'll use a softmaxt function to convert those scores into a probability distribution and then we will sample from that probability distribution to actually synthesize the second letter in the sequence. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">24:37</span></p>
<p>And in this case, even though the scores were pretty bad, maybe we got lucky and sampled the letter e from this probability distribution. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">24:47</span></p>
<p>And now, we'll take this letter e that was sampled from this distribution and feed it back as input into the network at the next time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">24:54</span></p>
<p>Now, we'll take this e, pull it down from the top, feed it back into the network as one of these, sort of, one hot vectorial representations, and then repeat the process in order to synthesize the second letter in the output. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">25:02</span></p>
<p>And we can repeat this process over and over again to synthesize a new sequence using this trained model, where we're synthesizing the sequence one character at a time using these predicted probability distributions at each time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">25:15</span></p>
<p>Question? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">25:27</span></p>
<p>Yeah, that's a great question. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">25:34</span></p>
<p>So the question is why might we sample instead of just taking the character with the largest score? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">25:36</span></p>
<p>In this case, because of the probability distribution that we had, it was impossible to get the right character, so we had the sample so the example could work out, and it would make sense. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">25:41</span></p>
<p>But in practice, sometimes you'll see both. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">25:51</span></p>
<p>So sometimes you'll just take the argmax probability, and that will sometimes be a little bit more stable, but one advantage of sampling, in general, is that it lets you get diversity from your models. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">25:54</span></p>
<p>Sometimes you might have the same input, maybe the same prefix, or in the case of image captioning, maybe the same image. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">26:04</span></p>
<p>But then if you sample rather than taking the argmax, then you'll see that sometimes these trained models are actually able to produce multiple different types of reasonable output sequences, depending on the kind, depending on which samples they take at the first time steps. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">26:11</span></p>
<p>It's actually kind of a benefit cause we can get now more diversity in our outputs. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">26:23</span></p>
<p>Another question? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">26:29</span></p>
<p>Could we feed in the softmax vector instead of the one element vector? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">26:35</span></p>
<p>You mean at test time? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">26:38</span></p>
<p>Yeah yeah, so the question is, at test time, could we feed in this whole softmax vector rather than a one hot vector? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">26:46</span></p>
<p>There's kind of two problems with that. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">26:51</span></p>
<p>One is that that's very different from the data that it saw at training time. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">26:52</span></p>
<p>In general, if you ask your model to do something at test time, which is different from training time, then it'll usually blow up. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">26:56</span></p>
<p>It'll usually give you garbage and you'll usually be sad. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">27:02</span></p>
<p>The other problem is that in practice, our vocabularies might be very large. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">27:05</span></p>
<p>So maybe, in this simple example, our vocabulary is only four elements, so it's not a big problem. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">27:09</span></p>
<p>But if you're thinking about generating words one at a time, now your vocabulary is every word in the English language, which could be something like tens of thousands of elements. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">27:13</span></p>
<p>So in practice, this first element, this first operation that's taking in this one hot vector, is often performed using sparse vector operations rather than dense factors. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">27:21</span></p>
<p>It would be, sort of, computationally really bad if you wanted to have this load of 10,000 elements softmax vector. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">27:30</span></p>
<p>So that's usually why we use a one hot instead, even at test time. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">27:36</span></p>
<p>This idea that we have a sequence and we produce an output at every time step of the sequence and then finally compute some loss, this is sometimes called backpropagation through time because you're imagining that in the forward pass, you're kind of stepping forward through time and then during the backward pass, you're sort of going backwards through time to compute all your gradients. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">27:42</span></p>
<p>This can actually be kind of problematic if you want to train the sequences that are very, very long. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">28:00</span></p>
<p>So if you imagine that we were kind of trying to train a neural network language model on maybe the entire text of Wikipedia, which is, by the way, something that people do pretty frequently, this would be super slow, and every time we made a gradient step, we would have to make a forward pass through the entire text of all of wikipedia, and then make a backward pass through all of wikipedia, and then make a single gradient update. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">28:06</span></p>
<p>And that would be super slow. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">28:27</span></p>
<p>Your model would never converge. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">28:28</span></p>
<p>It would also take a ridiculous amount of memory so this would be just really bad. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">28:29</span></p>
<p>In practice, what people do is this, sort of, approximation called truncated backpropagation through time. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">28:34</span></p>
<p>Here, the idea is that, even though our input sequence is very, very long, and even potentially infinite, what we'll do is that during, when we're training the model, we'll step forward for some number of steps, maybe like a hundred is kind of a ballpark number that people frequently use, and we'll step forward for maybe a hundred steps, compute a loss only over this sub sequence of the data, and then back propagate through this sub sequence, and now make a gradient step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">28:39</span></p>
<p>And now, when we repeat, well, we still have these hidden states that we computed from the first batch, and now, when we compute this next batch of data, we will carry those hidden states forward in time, so the forward pass will be exactly the same. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">29:06</span></p>
<p>But now when we compute a gradient step for this next batch of data, we will only backpropagate again through this second batch. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">29:20</span></p>
<p>Now, we'll make a gradient step based on this truncated backpropagation through time. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">29:28</span></p>
<p>This process will continue, where now when we make the next batch, we'll again copy these hidden states forward, but then step forward and then step backward, but only for some small number of time steps. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">29:32</span></p>
<p>So this is, you can kind of think of this as being an alegist who's the cast at gradient descent in the case of sequences. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">29:43</span></p>
<p>Remember, when we talked about training our models on large data sets, then these data sets, it would be super expensive to compute the gradients over every element in the data set. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">29:49</span></p>
<p>So instead, we kind of take small samples, small mini batches instead, and use mini batches of data to compute gradient stops in any kind of image classification case. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">29:58</span></p>
<p>Question? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">30:08</span></p>
<p>Is this kind of, the question is, is this kind of making the Mark Hobb assumption? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">30:12</span></p>
<p>No, not really. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">30:15</span></p>
<p>Because we're carrying this hidden state forward in time forever. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">30:18</span></p>
<p>It's making a Marcovian assumption in the sense that, conditioned on the hidden state, but the hidden state is all that we need to predict the entire future of the sequence. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">30:21</span></p>
<p>But that assumption is kind of built into the recurrent neural network formula from the start. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">30:31</span></p>
<p>And that's not really particular to back propagation through time. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">30:35</span></p>
<p>Back propagation through time, or sorry, truncated back prop though time is just the way to approximate these gradients without going making a backwards pass through your potentially very large sequence of data. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">30:39</span></p>
<p>This all sounds very complicated and confusing and it sounds like a lot of code to write, but in fact, this can acutally be pretty concise. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">30:52</span></p>
<p>Andrea has this example of what he calls min-char-rnn, that does all of this stuff in just like a 112 lines of Python. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">30:59</span></p>
<p>It handles building the vocabulary. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">31:07</span></p>
<p>It trains the model with truncated back propagation through time. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">31:09</span></p>
<p>And then, it can actually sample from that model in actually not too much code. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">31:11</span></p>
<p>So even though this sounds like kind of a big, scary process, it's actually not too difficult. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">31:16</span></p>
<p>I'd encourage you, if you're confused, to maybe go check this out and step through the code on your own time, and see, kind of, all of these concrete steps happening in code. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">31:20</span></p>
<p>So this is all in just a single file, all using numpy with no dependencies. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">31:27</span></p>
<p>This was relatively easy to read. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">31:31</span></p>
<p>So then, once we have this idea of training a recurrent neural network language model, we can actually have a lot of fun with this. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">31:35</span></p>
<p>And we can take in, sort of, any text that we want. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">31:41</span></p>
<p>Take in, like, whatever random text you can think of from the internet, train our recurrent neural network language model on this text, and then generate new text. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">31:43</span></p>
<p>So in this example, we took this entire text of all of Shakespeare's works, and then used that to train a recurrent neural network language model on all of Shakespeare. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">31:52</span></p>
<p>And you can see that the beginning of training, it's kind of producing maybe random gibberish garbage, but throughout the course of training, it ends up producing things that seem relatively reasonable. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">32:02</span></p>
<p>And after you've, after this model has been trained pretty well, then it produces text that seems, kind of, Shakespeare-esque to me. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">32:11</span></p>
<p>"Why do what that day," replied, whatever, right, you can read this. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">32:18</span></p>
<p>Like, it kind of looks kind of like Shakespeare. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">32:23</span></p>
<p>And if you actually train this model even more, and let it converge even further, and then sample these even longer sequences, you can see that it learns all kinds of crazy cool stuff that really looks like a Shakespeare play. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">32:24</span></p>
<p>It knows that it uses, maybe, these headings to say who's speaking. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">32:35</span></p>
<p>Then it produces these bits of text that have crazy dialogue that sounds kind of Shakespeare-esque. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">32:40</span></p>
<p>It knows to put line breaks in between these different things. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">32:45</span></p>
<p>And this is all, like, really cool, all just sort of learned from the structure of the data. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">32:47</span></p>
<p>We can actually get even crazier than this. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">32:52</span></p>
<p>This was one of my favorite examples. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">32:55</span></p>
<p>I found online, there's this. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">32:58</span></p>
<p>Is anyone a mathematician in this room? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">33:00</span></p>
<p>Has anyone taken an algebraic topology course by any chance? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">33:02</span></p>
<p>Wow, a couple, that's impressive. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">33:05</span></p>
<p>So you probably know more algebraic topology than me, but I found this open source algebraic topology textbook online. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">33:07</span></p>
<p>It's just a whole bunch of tech files that are like this super dense mathematics. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">33:15</span></p>
<p>And LaTac, cause LaTac is sort of this, let's you write equations and diagrams and everything just using plain text. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">33:19</span></p>
<p>We can actually train our recurrent neural network language model on the raw Latac source code of this algebraic topology textbook. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">33:26</span></p>
<p>And if we do that, then after we sample from the model, then we get something that seems like, kind of like algebraic topology. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">33:33</span></p>
<p>So it knows to like put equations. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">33:41</span></p>
<p>It puts all kinds of crazy stuff. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">33:43</span></p>
<p>It's like, to prove study, we see that F sub U is a covering of x prime, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">33:46</span></p>
<p>It knows where to put unions. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">33:52</span></p>
<p>It knows to put squares at the end of proofs. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">33:53</span></p>
<p>It makes lemmas. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">33:56</span></p>
<p>It makes references to previous lemmas. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">33:57</span></p>
<p>Right, like we hear, like. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">34:00</span></p>
<p>It's namely a bi-lemma question. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">34:01</span></p>
<p>We see that R is geometrically something. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">34:03</span></p>
<p>So it's actually pretty crazy. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">34:05</span></p>
<p>It also sometimes tries to make diagrams. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">34:09</span></p>
<p>For those of you that have taken algebraic topology, you know that these commutative diagrams are kind of a thing that you work with a lot So it kind of got the general gist of how to make those diagrams, but they actually don't make any sense. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">34:14</span></p>
<p>And actually, one of my favorite examples here is that it sometimes omits proofs. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">34:26</span></p>
<p>So it'll sometimes say, it'll sometimes say something like theorem, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, proof omitted. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">34:32</span></p>
<p>This thing kind of has gotten the gist of how some of these math textbooks look like. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">34:39</span></p>
<p>We can have a lot of fun with this. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">34:47</span></p>
<p>So we also tried training one of these models on the entire source code of the Linux kernel. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">34:49</span></p>
<p>'Cause again, this character level stuff that we can train on, And then, when we sample this, it acutally again looks like C source code. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">34:53</span></p>
<p>It knows how to write if statements. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">35:01</span></p>
<p>It has, like, pretty good code formatting skills. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">35:03</span></p>
<p>It knows to indent after these if statements. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">35:06</span></p>
<p>It knows to put curly braces. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">35:08</span></p>
<p>It actually even makes comments about some things that are usually nonsense. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">35:09</span></p>
<p>One problem with this model is that it knows how to declare variables. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">35:15</span></p>
<p>But it doesn't always use the variables that it declares. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">35:19</span></p>
<p>And sometimes it tries to use variables that haven't been declared. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">35:23</span></p>
<p>This wouldn't compile. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">35:26</span></p>
<p>I would not recommend sending this as a pull request to Linux. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">35:27</span></p>
<p>This thing also figures out how to recite the GNU, this GNU license character by character. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">35:30</span></p>
<p>It kind of knows that you need to recite the GNU license and after the license comes some includes, then some other includes, then source code. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">35:37</span></p>
<p>This thing has actually learned quite a lot about the general structure of the data. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">35:44</span></p>
<p>Where, again, during training, all we asked this model to do was try to predict the next character in the sequence. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">35:48</span></p>
<p>We didn't tell it any of this structure, but somehow, just through the course of this training process, it learned a lot about the latent structure in the sequential data. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">35:53</span></p>
<p>Yeah, so it knows how to write code. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">36:05</span></p>
<p>It does a lot of cool stuff. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">36:07</span></p>
<p>I had this paper with Andre a couple years ago where we trained a bunch of these models and then we wanted to try to poke into the brains of these models and figure out like what are they doing and why are they working. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">36:10</span></p>
<p>So we saw, in our, these recurring neural networks has this hidden vector which is, maybe, some vector that's updated over every time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">36:20</span></p>
<p>And then what we wanted to try to figure out is could we find some elements of this vector that have some Symantec interpretable meaning. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">36:28</span></p>
<p>So what we did is we trained a neural network language model, one of these character level models on one of these data sets, and then we picked one of the elements in that hidden vector and now we look at what is the value of that hidden vector over the course of a sequence to try to get some sense of maybe what these different hidden states are looking for. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">36:34</span></p>
<p>When you do this, a lot of them end up looking kind of like random gibberish garbage. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">36:52</span></p>
<p>So here again, what we've done, is we've picked one element of that vector, and now we run the sequence forward through the trained model, and now the color of each character corresponds to the magnitude of that single scaler element of the hidden vector at every time step when it's reading the sequence. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">36:56</span></p>
<p>So you can see that a lot of the vectors in these hidden states are kind of not very interpretable. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">37:10</span></p>
<p>It seems like they're kind of doing some of this low level language modeling to figure out what character should come next. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">37:15</span></p>
<p>But some of them end up quite nice. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">37:21</span></p>
<p>So here we found this vector that is looking for quotes. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">37:23</span></p>
<p>You can see that there's this one hidden element, this one element in the vector, that is off, off, off, off, off blue and then once it hits a quote, it turns on and remains on for the duration of this quote. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">37:26</span></p>
<p>And now when we hit the second quotation mark, then that cell turns off. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">37:39</span></p>
<p>So somehow, even though this model was only trained to predict the next character in a sequence, it somehow learned that a useful thing, in order to do this, might be to have some cell that's trying to detect quotes. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">37:42</span></p>
<p>We also found this other cell that is, looks like it's counting the number of characters since a line break. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">37:54</span></p>
<p>So you can see that at the beginning of each line, this element starts off at zero. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">38:00</span></p>
<p>Throughout the course of the line, it's gradually more red, so that value increases. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">38:04</span></p>
<p>And then after the new line character, it resets to zero. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">38:08</span></p>
<p>So you can imagine that maybe this cell is letting the network keep track of when it needs to write to produce these new line characters. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">38:11</span></p>
<p>We also found some that, when we trained on the linux source code, we found some examples that are turning on inside the conditions of if statements. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">38:19</span></p>
<p>So this maybe allows the network to differentiate whether it's outside an if statement or inside that condition, which might help it model these sequences better. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">38:27</span></p>
<p>We also found some that turn on in comments, or some that seem like they're counting the number of indentation levels. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">38:35</span></p>
<p>This is all just really cool stuff because it's saying that even though we are only trying to train this model to predict next characters, it somehow ends up learning a lot of useful structure about the input data. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">38:44</span></p>
<p>One kind of thing that we often use, so this is not really been computer vision so far, and we need to pull this back to computer vision since this is a vision class. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">38:57</span></p>
<p>We've alluded many times to this image captioning model where we want to build models that can input an image and then output a caption in natural language. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">39:05</span></p>
<p>There were a bunch of papers a couple years ago that all had relatively similar approaches. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">39:14</span></p>
<p>But I'm showing the figure from the paper from our lab in a totally un-biased way. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">39:19</span></p>
<p>But, the idea here is that the caption is this variably length sequence that we might, the sequence might have different numbers of words for different captions. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">39:26</span></p>
<p>So this is a totally natural fit for a recurrent neural network language model. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">39:35</span></p>
<p>So then what this model looks like is we have some convolutional network which will input the, which will take as input the image, and we've seen a lot about how convolution networks work at this point, and that convolutional network will produce a summary vector of the image which will then feed into the first time step of one of these recurrent neural network language models which will then produce words of the caption one at a time. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">39:39</span></p>
<p>So the way that this kind of works at test time after the model is trained looks almost exactly the same as these character level language models that we saw a little bit ago. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">40:02</span></p>
<p>We'll take our input image, feed it through our convolutional network. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">40:11</span></p>
<p>But now instead of taking the softmax scores from an image net model, we'll instead take this 4,096 dimensional vector from the end of the model, and we'll take that vector and use it to summarize the whole content of the image. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">40:14</span></p>
<p>Now, remember when we talked about RNN language models, we said that we need to see the language model with that first initial input to tell it to start generating text. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">40:31</span></p>
<p>So in this case, we'll give it some special start token, which is just saying, hey, this is the start of a sentence. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">40:39</span></p>
<p>Please start generating some text conditioned on this image information. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">40:45</span></p>
<p>So now previously, we saw that in this RNN language model, we had these matrices that were taking the previous, the input at the current time step and the hidden state of the previous time step and combining those to get the next hidden state. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">40:49</span></p>
<p>Well now, we also need to add in this image information. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">41:01</span></p>
<p>So one way, people play around with exactly different ways to incorporate this image information, but one simple way is just to add a third weight matrix that is adding in this image information at every time step to compute the next hidden state. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">41:04</span></p>
<p>So now, we'll compute this distribution over all scores in our vocabulary and here, our vocabulary is something like all English words, so it could be pretty large. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">41:18</span></p>
<p>We'll sample from that distribution and now pass that word back as input at the next time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">41:27</span></p>
<p>And that will then feed that word in, again get a distribution over all words in the vocab, and again sample to produce the next word. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">41:32</span></p>
<p>So then, after that thing is all done, we'll maybe generate, we'll generate this complete sentence. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">41:39</span></p>
<p>We stop generation once we sample the special ends token, which kind of corresponds to the period at the end of the sentence. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">41:47</span></p>
<p>Then once the network samples this ends token, we stop generation and we're done and we've gotten our caption for this image. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">41:54</span></p>
<p>And now, during training, we trained this thing to generate, like we put an end token at the end of every caption during training so that the network kind of learned during training that end tokens come at the end of sequences. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">42:00</span></p>
<p>So then, during test time, it tends to sample these end tokens once it's done generating. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">42:10</span></p>
<p>So we trained this model in kind of a completely supervised way. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">42:16</span></p>
<p>You can find data sets that have images together with natural language captions. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">42:20</span></p>
<p>Microsoft COCO is probably the biggest and most widely used for this task. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">42:24</span></p>
<p>But you can just train this model in a purely supervised way. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">42:28</span></p>
<p>And then backpropagate through to jointly train both this recurrent neural network language model and then also pass gradients back into this final layer of this the CNN and additionally update the weights of the CNN to jointly tune all parts of the model to perform this task. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">42:31</span></p>
<p>Once you train these models, they actually do some pretty reasonable things. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">42:47</span></p>
<p>These are some real results from a model, from one of these trained models, and it says things like a cat sitting on a suitcase on the floor, which is pretty impressive. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">42:52</span></p>
<p>It knows about cats sitting on a tree branch, which is also pretty cool. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">43:02</span></p>
<p>It knows about two people walking on the beach with surfboards. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">43:06</span></p>
<p>So these models are actually pretty powerful and can produce relatively complex captions to describe the image. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">43:09</span></p>
<p>But that being said, these models are really not perfect. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">43:16</span></p>
<p>They're not magical. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">43:19</span></p>
<p>Just like any machine learning model, if you try to run them on data that was very different from the training data, they don't work very well. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">43:21</span></p>
<p>So for example, this example, it says a woman is holding a cat in her hand. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">43:28</span></p>
<p>There's clearly no cat in the image. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">43:33</span></p>
<p>But she is wearing a fur coat, and maybe the texture of that coat kind of looked like a cat to the model. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">43:35</span></p>
<p>Over here, we see a woman standing on a beach holding a surfboard. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">43:41</span></p>
<p>Well, she's definitely not holding a surfboard and she's doing a handstand, which is maybe the interesting part of that image, and the model totally missed that. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">43:44</span></p>
<p>Also, over here, we see this example where there's this picture of a spider web in the tree branch, and it totally, and it says something like a bird sitting on a tree branch. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">43:51</span></p>
<p>So it totally missed the spider, but during training, it never really saw examples of spiders. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">44:00</span></p>
<p>It just knows that birds sit on tree branches during training. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">44:05</span></p>
<p>So it kind of makes these reasonable mistakes. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">44:08</span></p>
<p>Or here at the bottom, it can't really tell the difference between this guy throwing and catching the ball, but it does know that it's a baseball player and there's balls and things involved. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">44:10</span></p>
<p>So again, just want to say that these models are not perfect. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">44:17</span></p>
<p>They work pretty well when you ask them to caption images that were similar to the training data, but they definitely have a hard time generalizing far beyond that. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">44:20</span></p>
<p>So another thing you'll sometimes see is this slightly more advanced model called Attention, where now when we're generating the words of this caption, we can allow the model to steer it's attention to different parts of the image. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">44:29</span></p>
<p>And I don't want to spend too much time on this. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">44:41</span></p>
<p>But the general way that this works is that now our convolutional network, rather than producing a single vector summarizing the entire image, now it produces some grid of vectors that summarize the, that give maybe one vector for each spatial location in the image. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">44:44</span></p>
<p>And now, when we, when this model runs forward, in addition to sampling the vocabulary at every time step, it also produces a distribution over the locations in the image where it wants to look. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">44:59</span></p>
<p>And now this distribution over image locations can be seen as a kind of a tension of where the model should look during training. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">45:11</span></p>
<p>So now that first hidden state computes this distribution over image locations, which then goes back to the set of vectors to give a single summary vector that maybe focuses the attention on one part of that image. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">45:18</span></p>
<p>And now that summary vector gets fed, as an additional input, at the next time step of the neural network. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">45:31</span></p>
<p>And now again, it will produce two outputs. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">45:36</span></p>
<p>One is our distribution over vocabulary words. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">45:38</span></p>
<p>And the other is a distribution over image locations. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">45:40</span></p>
<p>This whole process will continue, and it will sort of do these two different things at every time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">45:43</span></p>
<p>And after you train the model, then you can see that it kind of will shift it's attention around the image for every word that it generates in the caption. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">45:50</span></p>
<p>Here you can see that it produced the caption, a bird is flying over, I can't see that far. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">45:58</span></p>
<p>But you can see that its attention is shifting around different parts of the image for each word in the caption that it generates. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">46:04</span></p>
<p>There's this notion of hard attention versus soft attention, which I don't really want to get into too much, but with this idea of soft attention, we're kind of taking a weighted combination of all features from all image locations, whereas in the hard attention case, we're forcing the model to select exactly one location to look at in the image at each time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">46:14</span></p>
<p>So the hard attention case where we're selecting exactly one image location is a little bit tricky because that is not really a differentiable function, so you need to do something slightly fancier than vanilla backpropagation in order to just train the model in that scenario. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">46:34</span></p>
<p>And I think we'll talk about that a little bit later in the lecture on reinforcement learning. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">46:46</span></p>
<p>Now, when you look at after you train one of these attention models and then run it on to generate captions, you can see that it tends to focus it's attention on maybe the salient or semanticly meaningful part of the image when generating captions. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">46:51</span></p>
<p>You can see that the caption was a woman is throwing a frisbee in a park and you can see that this attention mask, when it generated the word, when the model generated the word frisbee, at the same time, it was focusing it's attention on this image region that actually contains the frisbee. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">47:04</span></p>
<p>This is actually really cool. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">47:18</span></p>
<p>We did not tell the model where it should be looking at every time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">47:20</span></p>
<p>It sort of figured all that out for itself during the training process. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">47:24</span></p>
<p>Because somehow, it figured out that looking at that image region was the right thing to do for this image. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">47:27</span></p>
<p>And because everything in this model is differentiable, because we can backpropagate through all these soft attention steps, all of this soft attention stuff just comes out through the training process. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">47:32</span></p>
<p>So that's really, really cool. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">47:42</span></p>
<p>By the way, this idea of recurrent neural networks and attention actually gets used in other tasks beyond image captioning. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">47:45</span></p>
<p>One recent example is this idea of visual question answering. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">47:51</span></p>
<p>So here, our model is going to take two things as input. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">47:54</span></p>
<p>It's going to take an image and it will also take a natural language question that's asking some question about the image. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">47:58</span></p>
<p>Here, we might see this image on the left and we might ask the question, what endangered animal is featured on the truck? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">48:04</span></p>
<p>And now the model needs to select from one of these four natural language answers about which of these answers correctly answers that question in the context of the image. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">48:10</span></p>
<p>So you can imagine kind of stitching this model together using CNNs and RNNs in kind of a natural way. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">48:19</span></p>
<p>Now, we're in this many to one scenario, where now our model needs to take as input this natural language sequence, so we can imagine running a recurrent neural network over each element of that input question, to now summarize the input question in a single vector. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">48:24</span></p>
<p>And then we can have a CNN to again summarize the image, and now combine both the vector from the CNN and the vector from the question and coding RNN to then predict a distribution over answers. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">48:40</span></p>
<p>We also sometimes, you'll also sometimes see this idea of soft spacial attention being incorporated into things like visual question answering. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">48:51</span></p>
<p>So you can see that here, this model is also having the spatial attention over the image when it's trying to determine answers to the questions. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">48:59</span></p>
<p>Just to, yeah, question? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">49:07</span></p>
<p>So the question is How are the different inputs combined? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">49:18</span></p>
<p>Do you mean like the encoded question vector and the encoded image vector? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">49:20</span></p>
<p>Yeah, so the question is how are the encoded image and the encoded question vector combined? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">49:25</span></p>
<p>Kind of the simplest thing to do is just to concatenate them and stick them into fully connected layers. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">49:30</span></p>
<p>That's probably the most common and that's probably the first thing to try. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">49:34</span></p>
<p>Sometimes people do slightly fancier things where they might try to have multiplicative interactions between those two vectors to allow a more powerful function. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">49:37</span></p>
<p>But generally, concatenation is kind of a good first thing to try. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">49:44</span></p>
<p>Okay, so now we've talked about a bunch of scenarios where RNNs are used for different kinds of problems. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">49:49</span></p>
<p>And I think it's super cool because it allows you to start tackling really complicated problems combining images and computer vision with natural language processing. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">49:54</span></p>
<p>And you can see that we can kind of stith together these models like Lego blocks and attack really complicated things, Like image captioning or visual question answering just by stitching together these relatively simple types of neural network modules. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">50:04</span></p>
<p>But I'd also like to mention that so far, we've talked about this idea of a single recurrent network layer, where we have sort of one hidden state, and another thing that you'll see pretty commonly is this idea of a multilayer recurrent neural network. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">50:18</span></p>
<p>Here, this is a three layer recurrent neural network, so now our input goes in, goes into, goes in and produces a sequence of hidden states from the first recurrent neural network layer. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">50:32</span></p>
<p>And now, after we run kind of one recurrent neural network layer, then we have this whole sequence of hidden states. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">50:44</span></p>
<p>And now, we can use the sequence of hidden states as an input sequence to another recurrent neural network layer. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">50:50</span></p>
<p>And then you can just imagine, which will then produce another sequence of hidden states from the second RNN layer. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">50:56</span></p>
<p>And then you can just imagine stacking these things on top of each other, cause we know that we've seen in other contexts that deeper models tend to perform better for various problems. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">51:01</span></p>
<p>And the same kind of holds in RNNs as well. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">51:09</span></p>
<p>For many problems, you'll see maybe a two or three layer recurrent neural network model is pretty commonly used. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">51:11</span></p>
<p>You typically don't see super deep models in RNNs. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">51:18</span></p>
<p>So generally, like two, three, four layer RNNs is maybe as deep as you'll typically go. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">51:22</span></p>
<p>Then, I think it's also really interesting and important to think about, now we've seen kind of what kinds of problems these RNNs can be used for, but then you need to think a little bit more carefully about exactly what happens to these models when we try to train them. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">51:29</span></p>
<p>So here, I've drawn this little vanilla RNN cell that we've talked about so far. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">51:43</span></p>
<p>So here, we're taking our current input, x t, and our previous hidden state, h t minus one, and then we stack, those are two vectors. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">51:47</span></p>
<p>So we can just stack them together. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">51:55</span></p>
<p>And then perform this matrix multiplication with our weight matrix, to give our, and then squash that output through a tanh, and that will give us our next hidden state. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">51:57</span></p>
<p>And that's kind of the basic functional form of this vanilla recurrent neural network. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">52:05</span></p>
<p>But then, we need to think about what happens in this architecture during the backward pass when we try to compute gradients? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">52:10</span></p>
<p>So then if we think about trying to compute, so then during the backwards pass, we'll receive the derivative of our h t, we'll receive derivative of loss with respect to h t. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">52:17</span></p>
<p>And during the backward pass through the cell, we'll need to compute derivative of loss to the respect of h t minus one. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">52:28</span></p>
<p>Then, when we compute this backward pass, we see that the gradient flows backward through this red path. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">52:34</span></p>
<p>So first, that gradient will flow backwards through this tanh gate, and then it will flow backwards through this matrix multiplication gate. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">52:39</span></p>
<p>And then, as we've seen in the homework and when implementing these matrix multiplication layers, when you backpropagate through this matrix multiplication gate, you end up mulitplying by the transpose of that weight matrix. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">52:45</span></p>
<p>So that means that every time we backpropagate through one of these vanilla RNN cells, we end up multiplying by some part of the weight matrix. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">52:58</span></p>
<p>So now if you imagine that we are sticking many of these recurrent neural network cells in sequence, because again this is an RNN. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">53:09</span></p>
<p>We want a model sequences. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">53:15</span></p>
<p>Now if you imagine what happens to the gradient flow through a sequence of these layers, then something kind of fishy starts to happen. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">53:16</span></p>
<p>Because now, when we want to compute the gradient of the loss with respect to h zero, we need to backpropagate through every one of these RNN cells. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">53:23</span></p>
<p>And every time you backpropagate through one cell, you'll pick up one of these w transpose factors. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">53:30</span></p>
<p>So that means that the final expression for the gradient on h zero will involve many, many factors of this weight matrix, which could be kind of bad. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">53:35</span></p>
<p>Maybe don't think about the weight, the matrix case, but imagine a scaler case. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">53:44</span></p>
<p>If we end up, if we have some scaler and we multiply by that same number over and over and over again, maybe not for four examples, but for something like a hundred or several hundred time steps, then multiplying by the same number over and over again is really bad. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">53:50</span></p>
<p>In the scaler case, it's either going to explode in the case that that number is greater than one or it's going to vanish towards zero in the case that number is less than one in absolute value. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">54:03</span></p>
<p>And the only way in which this will not happen is if that number is exactly one, which is actually very rare to happen in practice. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">54:14</span></p>
<p>That leaves us to, that same intuition extends to the matrix case, but now, rather than the absolute value of a scaler number, you instead need to look at the largest, the largest singular value of this weight matrix. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">54:20</span></p>
<p>Now if that largest singular value is greater than one, then during this backward pass, when we multiply by the weight matrix over and over, that gradient on h w, on h zero, sorry, will become very, very large, when that matrix is too large. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">54:32</span></p>
<p>And that's something we call the exploding gradient problem. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">54:46</span></p>
<p>Where now this gradient will explode exponentially in depth with the number of time steps that we backpropagate through. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">54:48</span></p>
<p>And if the largest singular value is less than one, then we get the opposite problem, where now our gradients will shrink and shrink and shrink exponentially, as we backpropagate and pick up more and more factors of this weight matrix. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">54:55</span></p>
<p>That's called the vanishing gradient problem. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">55:05</span></p>
<p>THere's a bit of a hack that people sometimes do to fix the exploding gradient problem called gradient clipping, which is just this simple heuristic saying that after we compute our gradient, if that gradient, if it's L2 norm is above some threshold, then just clamp it down and divide, just clamp it down so it has this maximum threshold. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">55:08</span></p>
<p>This is kind of a nasty hack, but it actually gets used in practice quite a lot when training recurrent neural networks. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">55:27</span></p>
<p>And it's a relatively useful tool for attacking this exploding gradient problem. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">55:32</span></p>
<p>But now for the vanishing gradient problem, what we typically do is we might need to move to a more complicated RNN architecture. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">55:39</span></p>
<p>So that motivates this idea of an LSTM. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">55:46</span></p>
<p>An LSTM, which stands for Long Short Term Memory, is this slightly fancier recurrence relation for these recurrent neural networks. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">55:48</span></p>
<p>It's really designed to help alleviate this problem of vanishing and exploding gradients. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">55:58</span></p>
<p>So that rather than kind of hacking on top of it, we just kind of design the architecture to have better gradient flow properties. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">56:03</span></p>
<p>Kind of an analogy to those fancier CNN architectures that we saw at the top of the lecture. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">56:10</span></p>
<p>Another thing to point out is that the LSTM cell actually comes from 1997. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">56:16</span></p>
<p>So this idea of an LSTM has been around for quite a while, and these folks were working on these ideas way back in the 90s, were definitely ahead of the curve. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">56:20</span></p>
<p>Because these models are kind of used everywhere now 20 years later. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">56:28</span></p>
<p>And LSTMs kind of have this funny functional form. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">56:33</span></p>
<p>So remember when we had this vanilla recurrent neural network, it had this hidden state. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">56:37</span></p>
<p>And we used this recurrence relation to update the hidden state at every time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">56:42</span></p>
<p>Well, now in an LSTM, we actually have two, we maintain two hidden states at every time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">56:46</span></p>
<p>One is this h t, which is called the hidden state, which is kind of an analogy to the hidden state that we had in the vanilla RNN. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">56:51</span></p>
<p>But an LSTM also maintains the second vector, c t, called the cell state. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">56:59</span></p>
<p>And the cell state is this vector which is kind of internal, kept inside the LSTM, and it does not really get exposed to the outside world. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">57:03</span></p>
<p>And we'll see, and you can kind of see that through this update equation, where you can see that when we, first when we compute these, we take our two inputs, we use them to compute these four gates called i, f, o, n, g. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">57:12</span></p>
<p>We use those gates to update our cell states, c t, and then we expose part of our cell state as the hidden state at the next time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">57:25</span></p>
<p>This is kind of a funny functional form, and I want to walk through for a couple slides exactly why do we use this architecture and why does it make sense, especially in the context of vanishing or exploding gradients. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">57:36</span></p>
<p>This first thing that we do in an LSTM is that we're given this previous hidden state, h t, and we're given our current input vector, x t, and just like the vanilla RNN. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">57:47</span></p>
<p>In the vanilla RNN, remember, we took those two input vectors. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">57:58</span></p>
<p>We concatenated them. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">58:02</span></p>
<p>Then we did a matrix multiply to directly compute the next hidden state in the RNN. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">58:03</span></p>
<p>Now, the LSTM does something a little bit different. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">58:08</span></p>
<p>We're going to take our previous hidden state and our current input, stack them, and now multiply by a very big weight matrix, w, to compute four different gates, Which all have the same size as the hidden state. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">58:10</span></p>
<p>Sometimes, you'll see this written in different ways. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">58:24</span></p>
<p>Some authors will write a different weight matrix for each gate. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">58:26</span></p>
<p>Some authors will combine them all into one big weight matrix. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">58:30</span></p>
<p>But it's all really the same thing. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">58:33</span></p>
<p>The ideas is that we take our hidden state, our current input, and then we use those to compute these four gates. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">58:34</span></p>
<p>These four gates are the, you often see this written as i, f, o, g, ifog, which makes it pretty easy to remember what they are. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">58:40</span></p>
<p>I is the input gate. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">58:47</span></p>
<p>It says how much do we want to input into our cell. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">58:50</span></p>
<p>F is the forget gate. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">58:53</span></p>
<p>How much do we want to forget the cell memory at the previous, from the previous time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">58:55</span></p>
<p>O is the output gate, which is how much do we want to reveal ourself to the outside world. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">59:00</span></p>
<p>And G really doesn't have a nice name, so I usually call it the gate gate. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">59:04</span></p>
<p>G, it tells us how much do we want to write into our input cell. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">59:10</span></p>
<p>And then you notice that each of these four gates are using a different non linearity. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">59:14</span></p>
<p>The input, forget and output gate are all using sigmoids, which means that their values will be between zero and one. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">59:21</span></p>
<p>Whereas the gate gate uses a tanh, which means it's output will be between minus one and one. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">59:28</span></p>
<p>So, these are kind of weird, but it makes a little bit more sense if you imagine them all as binary values. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">59:34</span></p>
<p>Right, like what happens at the extremes of these two values? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">59:41</span></p>
<p>It's kind of what happens, if you look after we compute these gates if you look at this next equation, you can see that our cell state is being multiplied element wise by the forget gate. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">59:46</span></p>
<p>Sorry, our cell state from the previous time step is being multiplied element wise by this forget gate. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">59:53</span></p>
<p>And now if this forget gate, you can think of it as being a vector of zeros and ones, that's telling us for each element in the cell state, do we want to forget that element of the cell in the case if the forget gate was zero? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">59:59</span></p>
<p>Or do we want to remember that element of the cell in the case if the forget gate was one. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">60:10</span></p>
<p>Now, once we've used the forget gate to gate off the part of the cell state, then we have the second term, which is the element wise product of i and g. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">60:14</span></p>
<p>So now, i is this vector of zeros and ones, cause it's coming through a sigmoid, telling us for each element of the cell state, do we want to write to that element of the cell state in the case that i is one, or do we not want to write to that element of the cell state at this time step in the case that i is zero. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">60:24</span></p>
<p>And now the gate gate, because it's coming through a tanh, will be either one or minus one. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">60:41</span></p>
<p>So that is the value that we want, the candidate value that we might consider writing to each element of the cell state at this time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">60:46</span></p>
<p>Then if you look at the cell state equation, you can see that at every time step, the cell state has these kind of these different, independent scaler values, and they're all being incremented or decremented by one. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">60:54</span></p>
<p>So there's kind of like, inside the cell state, we can either remember or forget our previous state, and then we can either increment or decrement each element of that cell state by up to one at each time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">61:05</span></p>
<p>So you can kind of think of these elements of the cell state as being little scaler integer counters that can be incremented and decremented at each time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">61:16</span></p>
<p>And now, after we've computed our cell state, then we use our now updated cell state to compute a hidden state, which we will reveal to the outside world. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">61:25</span></p>
<p>So because this cell state has this interpretation of being counters, and sort of counting up by one or minus one at each time step, we want to squash that counter value into a nice zero to one range using a tanh. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">61:36</span></p>
<p>And now, we multiply element wise, by this output gate. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">61:48</span></p>
<p>And the output gate is again coming through a sigmoid, so you can think of it as being mostly zeros and ones, and the output gate tells us for each element of our cell state, do we want to reveal or not reveal that element of our cell state when we're computing the external hidden state for this time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">61:51</span></p>
<p>And then, I think there's kind of a tradition in people trying to explain LSTMs, that everyone needs to come up with their own potentially confusing LSTM diagram. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">62:09</span></p>
<p>So here's my attempt. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">62:17</span></p>
<p>Here, we can see what's going on inside this LSTM cell, is that we take our, we're taking as input on the left our previous cell state and the previous hidden state, as well as our current input, x t. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">62:20</span></p>
<p>Now we're going to take our current, our previous hidden state, as well as our current input, stack them, and then multiply with this weight matrix, w, to produce our four gates. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">62:31</span></p>
<p>And here, I've left out the non linearities because we saw those on a previous slide. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">62:41</span></p>
<p>And now the forget gate multiplies element wise with the cell state. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">62:44</span></p>
<p>The input and gate gate are multiplied element wise and added to the cell state. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">62:48</span></p>
<p>And that gives us our next cell. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">62:52</span></p>
<p>The next cell gets squashed through a tanh, and multiplied element wise with this output gate to produce our next hidden state. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">62:54</span></p>
<p>Question? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">63:02</span></p>
<p>No, So they're coming through this, they're coming from different parts of this weight matrix. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">63:13</span></p>
<p>So if our hidden, if our x and our h all have this dimension h, then after we stack them, they'll be a vector size two h, and now our weight matrix will be this matrix of size four h times two h. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">63:17</span></p>
<p>So you can think of that as sort of having four chunks of this weight matrix. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">63:30</span></p>
<p>And each of these four chunks of the weight matrix is going to compute a different one of these gates. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">63:34</span></p>
<p>You'll often see this written for clarity, kind of combining all four of those different weight matrices into a single large matrix, w, just for notational convenience. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">63:42</span></p>
<p>But they're all computed using different parts of the weight matrix. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">63:51</span></p>
<p>But you're correct in that they're all computed using the same functional form of just stacking the two things and taking the matrix multiplication. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">63:57</span></p>
<p>Now that we have this picture, we can think about what happens to an LSTM cell during the backwards pass? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">64:04</span></p>
<p>We saw, in the context of vanilla recurrent neural network, that some bad things happened during the backwards pass, where we were continually multiplying by that weight matrix, w. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">64:11</span></p>
<p>But now, the situation looks much, quite a bit different in the LSTM. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">64:18</span></p>
<p>If you imagine this path backwards of computing the gradients of the cell state, we get quite a nice picture. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">64:23</span></p>
<p>Now, when we have our upstream gradient from the cell coming in, then once we backpropagate backwards through this addition operation, remember that this addition just copies that upstream gradient into the two branches, so our upstream gradient gets copied directly and passed directly to backpropagating through this element wise multiply. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">64:29</span></p>
<p>So then our upstream gradient ends up getting multiplied element wise by the forget gate. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">64:50</span></p>
<p>As we backpropagate backwards through this cell state, the only thing that happens to our upstream cell state gradient is that it ends up getting multiplied element wise by the forget gate. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">64:56</span></p>
<p>This is really a lot nicer than the vanilla RNN for two reasons. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">65:07</span></p>
<p>One is that this forget gate is now an element wise multiplication rather than a full matrix multiplication. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">65:12</span></p>
<p>So element wise multiplication is going to be a little bit nicer than full matrix multiplication. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">65:18</span></p>
<p>Second is that element wise multiplication will potentially be multiplying by a different forget gate at every time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">65:24</span></p>
<p>So remember, in the vanilla RNN, we were continually multiplying by that same weight matrix over and over again, which led very explicitly to these exploding or vanishing gradients. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">65:31</span></p>
<p>But now in the LSTM case, this forget gate can vary from each time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">65:40</span></p>
<p>Now, it's much easier for the model to avoid these problems of exploding and vanishing gradients. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">65:45</span></p>
<p>Finally, because this forget gate is coming out from a sigmoid, this element wise multiply is guaranteed to be between zero and one, which again, leads to sort of nicer numerical properties if you imagine multiplying by these things over and over again. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">65:51</span></p>
<p>Another thing to notice is that in the context of the vanilla recurrent neural network, we saw that during the backward pass, our gradients were flowing through also a tanh at every time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">66:04</span></p>
<p>But now, in an LSTM, our outputs are, in an LSTM, our hidden state is used to compute those outputs, y t, so now, each hidden state, if you imagine backpropagating from the final hidden state back to the first cell state, then through that backward path, we only backpropagate through a single tanh non linearity rather than through a separate tanh at every time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">66:14</span></p>
<p>So kind of when you put all these things together, you can see this backwards pass backpropagating through the cell state is kind of a gradient super highway that lets gradients pass relatively unimpeded from the loss at the very end of the model all the way back to the initial cell state at the beginning of the model. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">66:42</span></p>
<p>Was there a question? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">66:59</span></p>
<p>Yeah, what about the gradient in respect to w? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">67:02</span></p>
<p>'Cause that's ultimately the thing that we care about. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">67:04</span></p>
<p>So, the gradient with respect to w will come through, at every time step, will take our current cell state as well as our current hidden state and that will give us an element, that will give us our local gradient on w for that time step. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">67:06</span></p>
<p>So because our cell state, and just in the vanilla RNN case, we'll end up adding those first time step w gradients to compute our final gradient on w. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">67:19</span></p>
<p>But now, if you imagine the situation where we have a very long sequence, and we're only getting gradients to the very end of the sequence. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">67:29</span></p>
<p>Now, as you backpropagate through, we'll get a local gradient on w for each time step, and that local gradient on w will be coming through these gradients on c and h. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">67:37</span></p>
<p>So because we're maintaining the gradients on c much more nicely in the LSTM case, those local gradients on w at each time step will also be carried forward and backward through time much more cleanly. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">67:48</span></p>
<p>Another question? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">68:01</span></p>
<p>Yeah, so the question is due to the non linearities, could this still be susceptible to vanishing gradients? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">68:17</span></p>
<p>And that could be the case. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">68:22</span></p>
<p>Actually, so one problem you might imagine is that maybe if these forget gates are always less than zero, or always less than one, you might get vanishing gradients as you continually go through these forget gates. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">68:24</span></p>
<p>Well, one sort of trick that people do in practice is that they will, sometimes, initialize the biases of the forget gate to be somewhat positive. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">68:34</span></p>
<p>So that at the beginning of training, those forget gates are always very close to one. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">68:42</span></p>
<p>So that at least at the beginning of training, then we have not so, relatively clean gradient flow through these forget gates, since they're all initialized to be near one. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">68:46</span></p>
<p>And then throughout the course of training, then the model can learn those biases and kind of learn to forget where it needs to. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">68:56</span></p>
<p>You're right that there still could be some potential for vanishing gradients here. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">69:02</span></p>
<p>But it's much less extreme than the vanilla RNN case, both because those fs can vary at each time step, and also because we're doing this element wise multiplication rather than a full matrix multiplication. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">69:06</span></p>
<p>So you can see that this LSTM actually looks quite similar to ResNet. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">69:19</span></p>
<p>In this residual network, we had this path of identity connections going backward through the network and that gave, sort of a gradient super highway for gradients to flow backward in ResNet. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">69:23</span></p>
<p>And now it's kind of the same intuition in LSTM where these additive and element wise multiplicative interactions of the cell state can give a similar gradient super highway for gradients to flow backwards through the cell state in an LSTM. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">69:32</span></p>
<p>And by the way, there's this other kind of nice paper called highway networks, which is kind of in between this idea of this LSTM cell and these residual networks. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">69:46</span></p>
<p>So these highway networks actually came before residual networks, and they had this idea where at every layer of the highway network, we're going to compute sort of a candidate activation, as well as a gating function that tells us that interprelates between our previous input at that layer, and that candidate activation that came through our convolutions or what not. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">69:57</span></p>
<p>So there's actually a lot of architectural similarities between these things, and people take a lot of inspiration from training very deep CNNs and very deep RNNs and there's a lot of crossover here. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">70:17</span></p>
<p>Very briefly, you'll see a lot of other types of variance of recurrent neural network architectures out there in the wild. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">70:27</span></p>
<p>Probably the most common, apart from the LSTM, is this GRU, called the gated recurrent unit. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">70:34</span></p>
<p>And you can see those update equations here, and it kind of has this similar flavor of the LSTM, where it uses these multiplicative element wise gates together with these additive interactions to avoid this vanishing gradient problem. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">70:40</span></p>
<p>There's also this cool paper called LSTM: a search based oddysey, very inventive title, where they tried to play around with the LSTM equations and swap out the non linearities at one point, like do we really need that tanh for exposing the output gate, and they tried to answer a lot of these different questions about each of those non linearities, each of those pieces of the LSTM update equations. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">70:53</span></p>
<p>What happens if we change the model and tweak those LSTM equations a little bit. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">71:14</span></p>
<p>And kind of the conclusion is that they all work about the same Some of them work a little bit better than others for one problem or another. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">71:18</span></p>
<p>But generally, none of the things, none of the tweaks of LSTM that they tried were significantly better that the original LSTM for all problems. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">71:24</span></p>
<p>So that gives you a little bit more faith that the LSTM update equations seem kind of magical but they're useful anyway. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">71:32</span></p>
<p>You should probably consider them for your problem. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">71:38</span></p>
<p>There's also this cool paper from Google a couple years ago where they tried to use, where they did kind of an evolutionary search and did a search over many, over a very large number of random RNN architectures, they kind of randomly premute these update equations and try putting the additions and the multiplications and the gates and the non linearities in different kinds of combinations. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">71:41</span></p>
<p>They blasted this out over their huge Google cluster and just tried a whole bunch of these different weigh updates in various flavors. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">72:00</span></p>
<p>And again, it was the same story that they didn't really find anything that was significantly better than these existing GRU or LSTM styles. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">72:08</span></p>
<p>Although there were some variations that worked maybe slightly better or worse for certain problems. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">72:15</span></p>
<p>But kind of the take away is that probably and using an LSTM or GRU is not so much magic in those equations, but this idea of managing gradient flow properly through these additive connections and these multiplicative gates is super useful. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">72:19</span></p>
<p>So yeah, the summary is that RNNs are super cool. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">72:34</span></p>
<p>They can allow you to attack tons of new types of problems. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">72:37</span></p>
<p>They sometimes are susceptible to vanishing or exploding gradients. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">72:40</span></p>
<p>But we can address that with weight clipping and with fancier architectures. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">72:43</span></p>
<p>And there's a lot of cool overlap between CNN architectures and RNN architectures. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">72:47</span></p>
<p>So next time, you'll be taking the midterm. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">72:52</span></p>
<p>But after that, we'll have a, sorry, a question? <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">72:53</span></p>
<p>Midterm is after this lecture so anything up to this point is fair game. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">72:59</span></p>
<p>And so you guys, good luck on the midterm on Tuesday. <span onclick="goVideo(this)" class="timestamp">73:04</span></p>
