# Transcription for cs231n courses

Downloaded from youtube.com.

Due to the limitations of my English, I missed the contents of the lecture when listening to the video directly. Made for deep study.

Combine fragmented sentences into one, and format them to look good in the browser.

If you press the time code at the end of the sentence, you are connected to the corresponding point in the video.

```
$ vim -s cleanup.vim <transcription.txt>
$ vim -s convert2html.vim <transcription.txt>
```
